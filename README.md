# cs430project02
Project 02 for CS 430 Computer Graphics

In this project we will write code to raycast mathematical primitives based on a scene input file into a pixel buffer. We will then write the pixel buffer to a PPM formatted file using the code you wrote in Project 1 (P3 or P6 format).
Our program should be resistant to errors and should not segfault or produce undefined behavior. If an error occurs, it should print a message to stderr with “Error:” prefixed to a descriptive error message before returning a non-zero error code.
